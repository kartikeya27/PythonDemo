## Prerequisites
1. Python 3.8
2. Requests packages for REST API.
3. selenium packages.
4. Pycharm is the edior I have use to run this automation (VENV environment).

## Pakcages install using pip3
1. pip install selenium (Opening chrome browser)
2. pip install requests )This packags are necessary to run REST API operation and also run the selenium
   on chrome browser)

## Regardarding to the first part of the automation (REST API)
1. Used requests module in this framework to make http calles to the server.
2. I have created Brand new Board then created two new lists. list and list1
   Then created 3 card under list then move one to list1 then remove it add a comment .
3. I did not use default To do, Doing and Done list having hard time to get idList id.
4. I have created one utilities folder and isside this folder I have created properties.ini, resources.py and configuration.py
   file to store the default value.

Rearding to second part I have use selenium with python. This one is pretty much straight forward.
